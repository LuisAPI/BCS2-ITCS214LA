# BCS2 ITCS214LA



The works of Luis Anton P. Imperial, 2nd-year student in Computer Science at De La Salle University–Dasmariñas, for the class Data Structures and Algorithms (class code: ITCS214).

This repository features scripts in Python as well as screenshots of outputs as requested by our professor, Ms. Flordeliza “Thonie” Fernandez (on GitHub as [shewhocode8](https://github.com/shewhocode8)).

>> - **linklist.py** (Fri, Sep 29) — Discussion on LinkedLists, which includes creative ways to recreate diagrams Ma'am Thonie made on the whiteboard.
> - activity
>> - **LinkedList.py** (Fri, Sep 29) — We were asked to rearrange a short linked list consisting of five values, from [6, 3, 4, 2, 1] to [6, 4, 3, 2, 1].
- s06

>> - **MidtermExam_[version].py** (Tue, Oct 3) — Our exams for our midterm period were a mix of fill-in-the-blank code and debugging.

Oftentimes, the prof requests them alongside the script itself for crosschecking, whenever we submit our work to Cypher Learning's NEO Learning Management System service (branded by our uni as Schoolbook).

## Table of files

Session | Type | File | Description
----|----|----|----
s01 | discussion | discussionM01.txt | This touches on data in the computing space and tools used to manipulate it.
s01 | activity | miniActivityS01-LImperial.txt | We were asked to write our name, as well as five of our self-described qualities and hobbies, on a plain text file and push it to a GitHub repository (which is this one).
s02 | discussion | mapSchool.py | (Tue, Aug 29) We were introduced to the concept of the Dijkstra algorithm, and, more broadly, programming a search for the fastest route for navigation purposes.
s02 | activity | mapSchoolAct_V5.py | A list of journeys was given wherein we must find the fastest route for all of them. The final version.
s03 | discussion | discussionArray.txt | Our third session was all about arrays and lists.
s03 | activity | MLabAct4_Imperial.py | (Tue, Sep 12) We created a function to define the bonus of salaried employees at a fictional company, using percentage values and ranges given by the professor.

## Discrepancies

Some of my classmates did not create a folder for the introduction session, instead placing the navigation script as `s01` and the salary script as `s02`. This archive syncs up with theirs starting at the elevator script done September 19, around our forth(-ish?) week of classes.
